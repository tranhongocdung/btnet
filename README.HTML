* Add SAPID & Address fields:
- Run the script update_table_orgs in root folder to add fields to database
- Run the website as normal to see the change

* Create a web API method to return all the projects in the db
- I created a new project called BTNETApi inside the root folder, using .NET Core 2.2, Entity Framework
- All the projects should be returned after the user is authorized then I implemented the Basic Authentication (for fast, in fact we can use JWT for more secured in real product)
- Update the Db connection string in appsettings.json, run the app
- Using the Postman (or whatever to call the api, add header Basic Authentication with any account to retrieve the data)
- Url to get projects: http://localhost:4000/api/project/getall
